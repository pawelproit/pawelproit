# Hello there! 👋
I'm a passionate software developer with a strong interest in high-level backend programming and object-oriented design. Currently exploring the world of microcontrollers and full-stack development. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and building projects that automate, simplify, or just make things a bit more fun!
